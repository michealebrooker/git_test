Mike's Notes about this html work

It's just a place to write memos about this site

So far, I've got my local git working, and am adding changes to files and new files, using locall

git add -A 

-A adds all files to the staging area

then

git commit -t "comment goes here

then 

git pull origin master - get the latest edits from the remote repo

and 

git push origin master - send the latest local edits up to the remote repo
